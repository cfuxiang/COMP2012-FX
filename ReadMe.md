#Supplementary Notes for COMP2012
This will mainly contain some extra content from the textbook (*this is by no means exhaustive*) which I think may be useful for students taking **COMP2012 Object-Oriented Programming and Data Structures** in **Fall 2017-18** from **Hong Kong University of Science and Technology**. Please read all official materials from the course website. **When there are discrepancies among the materials/content, the official materials/instructor's teaching/content will take precedence over this supplementary notes. Be warn, this set of notes may contain errors. If you spot an error, feel free to send me a PR.**

When you read this set of notes, it assumes you know OOP very well and have a good grasp in some strongly typed programming languages. It will omit a lot of content that are very similar to Java. It also assumes you have some knowledge and experiences in C\+\+ coding. The codes listed here are all in C\+\+. This set of notes might not be suitable for anyone without the aforementioned assumptions.

This set of notes is based on two recommended textbooks from the course website:
1. Paul Deitel, Deitel & Associates (2017). C\+\+ How to Program.
2. M.A. Weiss (2014). Data Structures and Algorithm Analysis in C\+\+.
